🚀 Project Name (You can use this on GitHub & LinkedIn)

AI Data Analyst Crew → Excel to Power BI Insights (End-to-End Automation)

Optional tagline (viral):

“Upload Excel. AI cleans data, generates KPIs, and auto-updates Power BI dashboards.”

🎯 ONE-LINE PROBLEM STATEMENT

Non-technical managers waste hours cleaning Excel and building dashboards.
This project uses AI agents to automate data cleaning, KPI generation, insights, and Power BI dashboards.

🧠 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE (BIG PICTURE)
4
End-to-End Flow

User uploads Excel / CSV

AI agents analyze the data

Data is cleaned + standardized

KPIs & metrics are generated automatically

Clean dataset feeds a Power BI template

Dashboard auto-refreshes

User gets:

AI-written insights

Executive-ready Power BI visuals

This is enterprise-style automation, not a toy project.

🧩 CORE COMPONENTS (WHAT EXACTLY WE ARE BUILDING)
1️⃣ Streamlit App (User Interface)
Purpose

This is the front door of your product.

What the user sees:

Upload Excel / CSV

Click “Run AI Analysis”

See:

Data quality summary

Business insights (text)

Embedded Power BI dashboard

💡 Streamlit = demo + MVP + SaaS feel.

2️⃣ CrewAI (The Brain 🧠)

This is where the magic happens.

You will build 3 AI agents, each with a clear role.

🤖 Agent 1: Data Cleaner Agent
Role

“Senior Data Engineer who prepares messy business data for analytics.”

What it does (VERY IMPORTANT):

Detects missing values

Removes duplicates

Fixes column names (snake_case, standard naming)

Converts data types:

dates → datetime

revenue → numeric

Flags data quality issues

Output:

cleaned_data.csv

data_quality_report.txt

💼 Enterprise relevance:
This alone replaces hours of manual Excel work.

🤖 Agent 2: KPI & Insight Generator Agent (SECRET SAUCE 🔥)

This is the most important agent.

Role

“Business Analyst who decides what metrics matter.”

What it does:

The agent THINKS, not just calculates.

It decides:

What is the main metric? (Revenue, Sales, Count, Usage)

What growth metrics are needed?

What categories matter?

KPIs it auto-generates:

Total Revenue / Total Sales

Month-over-Month (MoM) growth

Top-performing category

Best & worst segments

Outlier detection (sudden spikes/drops)

Output:

KPI-ready columns

Aggregated tables

insights.json

executive_insights.txt

👉 These KPIs are Power BI–ready
👉 No manual KPI definition needed

🤖 Agent 3: Storytelling Agent (LinkedIn VIRAL AGENT 🚀)
Role

“Consultant explaining the dashboard to leadership.”

What it generates:

3–5 key business takeaways

Risks & anomalies

Opportunities

Actionable recommendations

Example output:

“Revenue grew 18% MoM, driven mainly by Category A. However, Region C shows declining performance and requires immediate attention.”

This is what non-technical managers LOVE.

❌ What We Are NOT Doing (Intentionally)

❌ No manual chart creation

❌ No hardcoded dashboards

❌ No dataset-specific visuals

This is what makes it scalable.

📊 POWER BI PART (VERY CLEAR NOW)
🔑 Key Idea

We build ONE reusable Power BI dashboard template.

🧱 Power BI Template (.pbit)
This template already contains:

KPI cards (Total Revenue, Growth %)

Trend charts (time-based)

Category comparison charts

Filters (date, category, region)

What it does NOT contain:

Fixed data

Hardcoded values

🔄 How Automation Works

AI outputs cleaned_data.csv

Power BI is connected to this file

On refresh:

Dataset updates

KPIs recalculate

Visuals auto-update

🎉 Result:

Upload new Excel → Same dashboard → New insights

🧠 WHO CREATES KPIs & LOGIC?
Component	Responsibility
AI agents	Decide KPIs, structure data
Power BI	Display KPIs beautifully
You	Build ONE dashboard template

This is exactly how consultants work in real companies.
